The purpose is to automatic insertion of name of image files into a file (presentation.md).

* The file `list` contains the list of images in a directory named `images`.
* The file `addslide.sh` is the script to add `---` surrounded by the new lines and then inserting a line with image name from the file `list`.

The images must be in a images folder and the the file `list` can be generated by `echo ls images >list`

Rest of the files are for testing purposes.

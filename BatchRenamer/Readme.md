#BatchRenamer

In this script, a list of files of a particular directory is saved to a
file and then the file is iterated line by line to execute a command 
i.e. mv (to rename) in this case. You may change that command to
modify according to your needs.

Currently, you have to place the file in the same folder in which the
files are.

Give executable permission to it using:
chmod +x batchRenamer

Then execute it:
./batchRenamer

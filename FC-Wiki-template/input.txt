== How to use? == <!--T:8-->
[[File:Macro Recipes MacroHowToInstall.png|200px|left|Macro how to install]]
'''The above macros can easily be plugged on any FreeCAD installation'''
* Copy the macro python code from the corresponding macro page
* In FreeCAD, Macro->Macros->Create new, and give it a name
* Paste the python code you copied
* Hit the Save button, and restart FreeCAD
* Open the Macro manager, select your new macro and click "execute"
* Tutorial [[How to install macros]]

<!--T:9-->
'''Additionally, you can also add your new macro to a custom toolbar'''
* In FreeCAD, go to Tools -> Customize
* In the Macros tab, add a new macro, and, if you like, define an icon and a keyboard shortcut
* In the Toolbars tab, create a new toolbar, and add your macro, taking it from the "Macros" category.
* Tutorial [[Customize_ToolsBar|Customize ToolsBar]]
{{clear}}

== Adding new macros to this repository == <!--T:10-->
* Create a new page, beginning its name with "Macro", for example "Macro_My_Excellent_Macro", this can be done simply by editing this page, and adding a new link to your macro, like this:<br /> </translate><nowiki>"[[Macro My Excellent Macro]]: My excellent macro"</nowiki>.<translate> <!--T:11-->
A new page (red link) will be created.
* In that page, paste the following text:

<!--T:12-->
(With the default icon)
</translate>
 <nowiki>{{Macro|Icon=Text-x-python|Name=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Description=What my excellent macro does|Author=your username}}</nowiki>
<translate>
<!--T:13-->
(With the icon custom)
</translate>
 <nowiki>{{Macro|Icon=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Name=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Description=What my excellent macro does|Author=your username}}</nowiki>
<translate>
<!--T:14-->
(Another language with the default icon (example "/fr" "/de" "/it"....))
</translate>
 <nowiki>{{Macro/fr|Icon=Text-x-python|Name=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Name/fr=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Description=
 What my excellent macro does|Author=your username}}</nowiki>
<translate>
<!--T:15-->
(Another language with the icon custom (example "/fr" "/de" "/it"....))
</translate>
 <nowiki>{{Macro/fr|Icon=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Name=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Name/fr=Macro_My_Excellent_Macro|Description=
 What my excellent macro does|Author=your username}}</nowiki>
<translate>
<!--T:16-->
*You can also [http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Upload Upload ] a custom format icon'''.png'''<br />'''Note that the name of the icon must have the same name as the name of the macro'''.
**example : " Macro_My_Excellent_Macro " '''without extension''' (the extension is given by the system), and, replace " Icon='''Text-x-python''' " by " Icon='''Macro_My_Excellent_Macro''' "
**'''Text-x-python''' [[Image:Text-x-python.png|32px]] is the default icon of the page dedicated to the Macro.

<!--T:17-->
* Paste your macro, and use the [[Template:Code|Code template]] to avoid adding spaces into your script. This will display the macro in a monospace font inside a light grey box like the example above.
* If you like, upload a .png icon with the exact same name as your macro page (ex. Macro_My_Excellent_Macro.png)
* Add an image: an image is useful to show what the macro does. Optionally you can create an animated gif that represents the object in context. The gif image should have a maximum size of 500x500px as the wiki does not resize animated gifs; if the gif is any bigger the animation won't work.
* Optionally you can add some more info on how to use your macro, tips, limitations and workaround.
* It is also interesting to include version information in your macro. This macro allows you to locate in time compared to the evolution of FreeCAD, do "Menu > Help > About FreeCAD and click to Copy to clipboard" and paste it your macro

It is also advisable to create a macro in your header, this header can be used by the [http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=10556 Plugin Loader] program to install the macro and check versions. Also available [https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons addons_installer.FCMacro]
